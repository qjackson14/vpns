<h2>What Are VPNs & Why Are They Useful: </h2>

VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) are secure connections that route internet traffic through an encrypted tunnel, masking the user's IP address and encrypting data to protect it from unauthorized access. VPNs are particularly useful for ensuring privacy and security when accessing the internet, especially on public Wi-Fi networks. They allow remote workers to securely connect to their company's internal network, accessing resources as if they were physically present in the office. This is crucial for maintaining data security and confidentiality. Additionally, VPNs can bypass geographic restrictions and censorship, providing access to content and services that might be blocked in certain regions. Overall, VPNs enhance security, privacy, and accessibility, making them invaluable for both personal and professional use.
